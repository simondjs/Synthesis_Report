# Synthesis_Report
Analyzing IUCN Red List global population data to determine the proportion of species population that above minimum viable population thresholds proposed by Franklin (1980) and Soul√© (1980) vs. Frankham (2014).

[Synthesis_Report2.R](Synthesis_Report2.R) contains code used to create [the plot](Plot.png) from the [dataset](LPD2022_public.csv) obtained from [The IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/en). Note that the dataset contains a myriad of measurement units; I tried my best to filter out all those which did not record the number of individuals in a population, but the resulting figure should nonetheless be taken with several grains of salt as it is only intended to provide a general insight.
